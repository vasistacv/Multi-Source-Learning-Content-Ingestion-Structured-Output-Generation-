AI/ML CHALLENGES
 

Challenge 1: AI-Driven Automated Interviewer for Project Presentations 

Objective​
 Build an AI system that listens to a student presenting a project (screen share + speech) and 
conducts an adaptive interview based on content and responses. 

Functional Requirements 

●​ Presentation Understanding 
○​ Extract content from screens using OCR. 
○​ Transcribe student speech using STT. 
○​ Analyze UI, code snippets, slides, diagrams. 

●​ Dynamic Interviewing 
○​ Generate context-aware questions from extracted content. 
○​ Ask follow-up questions based on responses and screen content. 

●​ Evaluation & Feedback 
○​ Score student on: 

■​ Technical depth 
■​ Clarity of explanation 
■​ Originality 
■​ Understanding of implementation​

 

Deliverable​
A live demo where a student presents a project, the system interviews them in real time, and 
produces a score + feedback report. 

 

Challenge 2: Ultra-Lightweight Client-Side AI for Voice Interview Summaries 

Objective​
 Develop a <30MB client-side AI model that generates filler phrases and real-time summaries to 
enhance automated voice interviews in the browser. 

Requirements 

●​ Constraints 
○​ Model size ≤30MB 
○​ Fully client-side (ONNX / WASM) 



○​ Inference latency <50ms 
●​ Tasks 

○​ Real-time summarization of conversation text 
○​ Detect pauses in text-to-speech responses 
○​ Insert contextual filler phrases using same TTS output 

●​ Success Criteria 
○​ Runs offline 
○​ No perceivable lag 
○​ Accurate, meaningful filler + summary generation​

 

Deliverable​
 A working web demo displaying live summary updates, filler playback, load time, and response 
time metrics. 

 

 



FULLSTACK DEVELOPER CHALLENGES 
 

Challenge 4: Progressive Student Dashboard (Full-Stack) 

Objective​
 Build a web application that tracks student progress across courses, recommends next steps, 
and visualizes learning insights. 

Core Features 

●​ Email authentication, student + mentor roles 
●​ Dashboard showing: 

○​ Completed lessons 
○​ Time spent 
○​ Progress per course 

●​ Visualizations: 
○​ Trend chart (time series) 
○​ Pie/donut (distribution or completion status)​

 
●​ Backend API for: 

○​ Auth 
○​ Aggregates & time-series data 
○​ Lesson details 
○​ Activity events 

●​ Seeded sample data + clear setup instructions 

Stretch Features 

●​ Adaptive recommendations 
●​ Export to CSV 
●​ Mentor dashboards 
●​ Tests + responsive UI 

Deliverables 

●​ Full-stack repo + seed data 
●​ API documentation + screenshots 

 

Challenge 5: Live Classroom Collaboration Platform 



Objective​
 Create a lightweight real-time collaboration tool for classroom learning with co-solving 
capabilities, shared notes, polling, chat, and low-latency sync. 

Functional Requirements 

●​ Real-time shared content (notes, chat, co-solving) 
●​ Live feedback + polling 
●​ Session persistence & exports 
●​ Secure access control 

Constraints 

●​ Low latency 
●​ Lightweight deployment (free tier friendly) 
●​ Privacy-first design 

Deliverables 

●​ Working multi-user demo 
●​ Synced notes + live poll visualization 
●​ Exportable session summary 

 

Challenge 6: Multi-Source Learning Content Ingestion & Structured Output 
Generation 

Objective​
 Ingest content from PDFs, videos, documents, transcripts, and generate structured learning 
artifacts (flashcards, summaries, concept graphs). 

Functional Requirements 

●​ Parse multiple file types 
●​ Extract key concepts + topic hierarchy 
●​ Auto-generate structured educational outputs 
●​ Store and enable retrieval by topic 

Deliverables 

●​ CLI or web tool ingesting files 
●​ JSON/CSV flashcards 
●​ Concept graph or learning path 

 



Challenge 7: Turn Recurring Meeting Knowledge Into Training Modules 

Objective​
 Convert recurring meeting notes into reusable training modules (tutorials, FAQs, how-tos, 
role-based learning paths). 

Functional Requirements 

●​ Ingest multiple meeting notes 
●​ Detect recurring themes 
●​ Extract structured steps & definitions 
●​ Render into markdown or LMS-ready format 
●​ Track changes over time 

Deliverables 

●​ Script or app generating modules 
●​ Versioning + topic mapping 
●​ Knowledge base organized by roles/projects
