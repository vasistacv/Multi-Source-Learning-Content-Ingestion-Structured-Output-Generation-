# Deep Learning - Lecture 7: Generative Models

Date: 2026-01-07
Instructor: Dr. Sarah Chen
Duration: 90 minutes

## Lecture Overview

Today's focus: **Generative Models**

This lecture explores GANs, VAEs, diffusion models, with theoretical foundations, 
practical implementations, and real-world applications.

## Key Learning Outcomes

By the end of this lecture, students will be able to:
1. Understand the core concepts of Generative Models
2. Implement algorithms related to GANs, VAEs, diffusion models
3. Apply these techniques to real datasets
4. Recognize when to use these methods in practice

## Detailed Content

### Part 1: Theoretical Foundation (Generative Models)

GANs, VAEs, diffusion models

Mathematical formulation and algorithmic principles demonstrated through step-by-step derivations.
Complexity analysis: Time O(n²), Space O(n) for typical implementations.

### Part 2: Implementation

```python
# Example code for Generative Models
import numpy as np

def example_algorithm(data, params):
    # Core implementation of Generative Models
    result = process(data)
    return result
```

### Part 3: Real-World Applications

Case study: How Generative Models is used in industry applications including:
- E-commerce recommendation systems
- Medical imaging diagnostics
- Financial fraud detection
- Autonomous vehicle perception

### Part 4: Advanced Considerations

- Handling edge cases and corner scenarios
- Performance optimization techniques
- Recent research developments in Generative Models
- Comparison with alternative approaches

## Hands-On Exercise

Dataset: UCI Machine Learning Repository - Deep Learning Dataset
Task: Implement Generative Models and achieve >85% accuracy on test set

## Homework Assignment

Due: Next week before lecture

1. Implement the Generative Models algorithm from scratch
2. Compare performance with sklearn/PyTorch implementation
3. Write a 2-page analysis of results
4. Prepare questions for next lecture
