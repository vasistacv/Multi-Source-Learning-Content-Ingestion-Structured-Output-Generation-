# Machine Learning - Lecture 4: Random Forests

Date: 2026-01-04
Instructor: Dr. Sarah Chen
Duration: 90 minutes

## Lecture Overview

Today's focus: **Random Forests**

This lecture explores ensemble methods, bagging, feature importance, with theoretical foundations, 
practical implementations, and real-world applications.

## Key Learning Outcomes

By the end of this lecture, students will be able to:
1. Understand the core concepts of Random Forests
2. Implement algorithms related to ensemble methods, bagging, feature importance
3. Apply these techniques to real datasets
4. Recognize when to use these methods in practice

## Detailed Content

### Part 1: Theoretical Foundation (Random Forests)

ensemble methods, bagging, feature importance

Mathematical formulation and algorithmic principles demonstrated through step-by-step derivations.
Complexity analysis: Time O(n²), Space O(n) for typical implementations.

### Part 2: Implementation

```python
# Example code for Random Forests
import numpy as np

def example_algorithm(data, params):
    # Core implementation of Random Forests
    result = process(data)
    return result
```

### Part 3: Real-World Applications

Case study: How Random Forests is used in industry applications including:
- E-commerce recommendation systems
- Medical imaging diagnostics
- Financial fraud detection
- Autonomous vehicle perception

### Part 4: Advanced Considerations

- Handling edge cases and corner scenarios
- Performance optimization techniques
- Recent research developments in Random Forests
- Comparison with alternative approaches

## Hands-On Exercise

Dataset: UCI Machine Learning Repository - Machine Learning Dataset
Task: Implement Random Forests and achieve >85% accuracy on test set

## Homework Assignment

Due: Next week before lecture

1. Implement the Random Forests algorithm from scratch
2. Compare performance with sklearn/PyTorch implementation
3. Write a 2-page analysis of results
4. Prepare questions for next lecture
