# Computer Vision - Lecture 1: Image Basics

Date: 2026-01-01
Instructor: Dr. Sarah Chen
Duration: 90 minutes

## Lecture Overview

Today's focus: **Image Basics**

This lecture explores pixels, channels, convolution filters, with theoretical foundations, 
practical implementations, and real-world applications.

## Key Learning Outcomes

By the end of this lecture, students will be able to:
1. Understand the core concepts of Image Basics
2. Implement algorithms related to pixels, channels, convolution filters
3. Apply these techniques to real datasets
4. Recognize when to use these methods in practice

## Detailed Content

### Part 1: Theoretical Foundation (Image Basics)

pixels, channels, convolution filters

Mathematical formulation and algorithmic principles demonstrated through step-by-step derivations.
Complexity analysis: Time O(n²), Space O(n) for typical implementations.

### Part 2: Implementation

```python
# Example code for Image Basics
import numpy as np

def example_algorithm(data, params):
    # Core implementation of Image Basics
    result = process(data)
    return result
```

### Part 3: Real-World Applications

Case study: How Image Basics is used in industry applications including:
- E-commerce recommendation systems
- Medical imaging diagnostics
- Financial fraud detection
- Autonomous vehicle perception

### Part 4: Advanced Considerations

- Handling edge cases and corner scenarios
- Performance optimization techniques
- Recent research developments in Image Basics
- Comparison with alternative approaches

## Hands-On Exercise

Dataset: UCI Machine Learning Repository - Computer Vision Dataset
Task: Implement Image Basics and achieve >85% accuracy on test set

## Homework Assignment

Due: Next week before lecture

1. Implement the Image Basics algorithm from scratch
2. Compare performance with sklearn/PyTorch implementation
3. Write a 2-page analysis of results
4. Prepare questions for next lecture
