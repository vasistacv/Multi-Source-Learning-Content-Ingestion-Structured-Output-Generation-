# Reinforcement Learning - Lecture 2: Value Iteration

Date: 2026-01-02
Instructor: Dr. Sarah Chen
Duration: 90 minutes

## Lecture Overview

Today's focus: **Value Iteration**

This lecture explores dynamic programming, policy iteration, optimal policies, with theoretical foundations, 
practical implementations, and real-world applications.

## Key Learning Outcomes

By the end of this lecture, students will be able to:
1. Understand the core concepts of Value Iteration
2. Implement algorithms related to dynamic programming, policy iteration, optimal policies
3. Apply these techniques to real datasets
4. Recognize when to use these methods in practice

## Detailed Content

### Part 1: Theoretical Foundation (Value Iteration)

dynamic programming, policy iteration, optimal policies

Mathematical formulation and algorithmic principles demonstrated through step-by-step derivations.
Complexity analysis: Time O(n²), Space O(n) for typical implementations.

### Part 2: Implementation

```python
# Example code for Value Iteration
import numpy as np

def example_algorithm(data, params):
    # Core implementation of Value Iteration
    result = process(data)
    return result
```

### Part 3: Real-World Applications

Case study: How Value Iteration is used in industry applications including:
- E-commerce recommendation systems
- Medical imaging diagnostics
- Financial fraud detection
- Autonomous vehicle perception

### Part 4: Advanced Considerations

- Handling edge cases and corner scenarios
- Performance optimization techniques
- Recent research developments in Value Iteration
- Comparison with alternative approaches

## Hands-On Exercise

Dataset: UCI Machine Learning Repository - Reinforcement Learning Dataset
Task: Implement Value Iteration and achieve >85% accuracy on test set

## Homework Assignment

Due: Next week before lecture

1. Implement the Value Iteration algorithm from scratch
2. Compare performance with sklearn/PyTorch implementation
3. Write a 2-page analysis of results
4. Prepare questions for next lecture
