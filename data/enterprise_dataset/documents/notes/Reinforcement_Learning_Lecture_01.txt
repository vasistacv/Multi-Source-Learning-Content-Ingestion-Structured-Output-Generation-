# Reinforcement Learning - Lecture 1: MDP Fundamentals

Date: 2026-01-01
Instructor: Dr. Sarah Chen
Duration: 90 minutes

## Lecture Overview

Today's focus: **MDP Fundamentals**

This lecture explores states, actions, rewards, Bellman equations, with theoretical foundations, 
practical implementations, and real-world applications.

## Key Learning Outcomes

By the end of this lecture, students will be able to:
1. Understand the core concepts of MDP Fundamentals
2. Implement algorithms related to states, actions, rewards, Bellman equations
3. Apply these techniques to real datasets
4. Recognize when to use these methods in practice

## Detailed Content

### Part 1: Theoretical Foundation (MDP Fundamentals)

states, actions, rewards, Bellman equations

Mathematical formulation and algorithmic principles demonstrated through step-by-step derivations.
Complexity analysis: Time O(n²), Space O(n) for typical implementations.

### Part 2: Implementation

```python
# Example code for MDP Fundamentals
import numpy as np

def example_algorithm(data, params):
    # Core implementation of MDP Fundamentals
    result = process(data)
    return result
```

### Part 3: Real-World Applications

Case study: How MDP Fundamentals is used in industry applications including:
- E-commerce recommendation systems
- Medical imaging diagnostics
- Financial fraud detection
- Autonomous vehicle perception

### Part 4: Advanced Considerations

- Handling edge cases and corner scenarios
- Performance optimization techniques
- Recent research developments in MDP Fundamentals
- Comparison with alternative approaches

## Hands-On Exercise

Dataset: UCI Machine Learning Repository - Reinforcement Learning Dataset
Task: Implement MDP Fundamentals and achieve >85% accuracy on test set

## Homework Assignment
