# NLP - Lecture 2: Word Embeddings

Date: 2026-01-02
Instructor: Dr. Sarah Chen
Duration: 90 minutes

## Lecture Overview

Today's focus: **Word Embeddings**

This lecture explores Word2Vec, GloVe, contextual embeddings, with theoretical foundations, 
practical implementations, and real-world applications.

## Key Learning Outcomes

By the end of this lecture, students will be able to:
1. Understand the core concepts of Word Embeddings
2. Implement algorithms related to Word2Vec, GloVe, contextual embeddings
3. Apply these techniques to real datasets
4. Recognize when to use these methods in practice

## Detailed Content

### Part 1: Theoretical Foundation (Word Embeddings)

Word2Vec, GloVe, contextual embeddings

Mathematical formulation and algorithmic principles demonstrated through step-by-step derivations.
Complexity analysis: Time O(n²), Space O(n) for typical implementations.

### Part 2: Implementation

```python
# Example code for Word Embeddings
import numpy as np

def example_algorithm(data, params):
    # Core implementation of Word Embeddings
    result = process(data)
    return result
```

### Part 3: Real-World Applications

Case study: How Word Embeddings is used in industry applications including:
- E-commerce recommendation systems
- Medical imaging diagnostics
- Financial fraud detection
- Autonomous vehicle perception

### Part 4: Advanced Considerations

- Handling edge cases and corner scenarios
- Performance optimization techniques
- Recent research developments in Word Embeddings
- Comparison with alternative approaches

## Hands-On Exercise

Dataset: UCI Machine Learning Repository - NLP Dataset
Task: Implement Word Embeddings and achieve >85% accuracy on test set

## Homework Assignment

Due: Next week before lecture

1. Implement the Word Embeddings algorithm from scratch
2. Compare performance with sklearn/PyTorch implementation
3. Write a 2-page analysis of results
4. Prepare questions for next lecture
