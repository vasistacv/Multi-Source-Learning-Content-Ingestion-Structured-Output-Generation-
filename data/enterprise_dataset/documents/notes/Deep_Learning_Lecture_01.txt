Date: 2026-01-01
Instructor: Dr. Sarah Chen
Duration: 90 minutes

## Lecture Overview

Today's focus: **Neural Network Fundamentals**

This lecture explores perceptron, activation functions, forward propagation, with theoretical foundations, 
practical implementations, and real-world applications.

## Key Learning Outcomes

By the end of this lecture, students will be able to:
1. Understand the core concepts of Neural Network Fundamentals
2. Implement algorithms related to perceptron, activation functions, forward propagation
3. Apply these techniques to real datasets
4. Recognize when to use these methods in practice

## Detailed Content

### Part 1: Theoretical Foundation (Neural Network Fundamentals)

perceptron, activation functions, forward propagation

Mathematical formulation and algorithmic principles demonstrated through step-by-step derivations.
Complexity analysis: Time O(n²), Space O(n) for typical implementations.

### Part 2: Implementation

```python
# Example code for Neural Network Fundamentals
import numpy as np

def example_algorithm(data, params):
    # Core implementation of Neural Network Fundamentals
    result = process(data)
    return result
```

### Part 3: Real-World Applications

Case study: How Neural Network Fundamentals is used in industry applications including:
- E-commerce recommendation systems
- Medical imaging diagnostics
