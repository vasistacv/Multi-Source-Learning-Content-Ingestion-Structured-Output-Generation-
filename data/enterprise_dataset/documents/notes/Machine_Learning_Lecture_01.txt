# Machine Learning - Lecture 1: Linear Regression

Date: 2026-01-01
Instructor: Dr. Sarah Chen
Duration: 90 minutes

## Lecture Overview

Today's focus: **Linear Regression**

This lecture explores y = mx + b, gradient descent, MSE optimization, with theoretical foundations, 
practical implementations, and real-world applications.

## Key Learning Outcomes

By the end of this lecture, students will be able to:
1. Understand the core concepts of Linear Regression
2. Implement algorithms related to y = mx + b, gradient descent, MSE optimization
3. Apply these techniques to real datasets
4. Recognize when to use these methods in practice

## Detailed Content

### Part 1: Theoretical Foundation (Linear Regression)

y = mx + b, gradient descent, MSE optimization

Mathematical formulation and algorithmic principles demonstrated through step-by-step derivations.
Complexity analysis: Time O(n²), Space O(n) for typical implementations.

### Part 2: Implementation

```python
# Example code for Linear Regression
import numpy as np

def example_algorithm(data, params):
    # Core implementation of Linear Regression
    result = process(data)
    return result
```

### Part 3: Real-World Applications

Case study: How Linear Regression is used in industry applications including:
- E-commerce recommendation systems
- Medical imaging diagnostics
- Financial fraud detection
- Autonomous vehicle perception

### Part 4: Advanced Considerations

- Handling edge cases and corner scenarios
- Performance optimization techniques
- Recent research developments in Linear Regression
- Comparison with alternative approaches

## Hands-On Exercise

Dataset: UCI Machine Learning Repository - Machine Learning Dataset
Task: Implement Linear Regression and achieve >85% accuracy on test set

## Homework Assignment

Due: Next week before lecture

1. Implement the Linear Regression algorithm from scratch
2. Compare performance with sklearn/PyTorch implementation
3. Write a 2-page analysis of results
4. Prepare questions for next lecture
