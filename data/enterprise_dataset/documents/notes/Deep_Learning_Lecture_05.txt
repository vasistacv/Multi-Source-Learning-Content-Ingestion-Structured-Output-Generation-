# Deep Learning - Lecture 5: Recurrent Networks

Date: 2026-01-05
Instructor: Dr. Sarah Chen
Duration: 90 minutes

## Lecture Overview

Today's focus: **Recurrent Networks**

This lecture explores LSTM, GRU, handling sequences, with theoretical foundations, 
practical implementations, and real-world applications.

## Key Learning Outcomes

By the end of this lecture, students will be able to:
1. Understand the core concepts of Recurrent Networks
2. Implement algorithms related to LSTM, GRU, handling sequences
3. Apply these techniques to real datasets
4. Recognize when to use these methods in practice

## Detailed Content

### Part 1: Theoretical Foundation (Recurrent Networks)

LSTM, GRU, handling sequences

Mathematical formulation and algorithmic principles demonstrated through step-by-step derivations.
Complexity analysis: Time O(n²), Space O(n) for typical implementations.

### Part 2: Implementation

```python
# Example code for Recurrent Networks
import numpy as np

def example_algorithm(data, params):
    # Core implementation of Recurrent Networks
    result = process(data)
    return result
```

### Part 3: Real-World Applications

Case study: How Recurrent Networks is used in industry applications including:
- E-commerce recommendation systems
- Medical imaging diagnostics
- Financial fraud detection
- Autonomous vehicle perception

### Part 4: Advanced Considerations

- Handling edge cases and corner scenarios
- Performance optimization techniques
- Recent research developments in Recurrent Networks
- Comparison with alternative approaches

## Hands-On Exercise

Dataset: UCI Machine Learning Repository - Deep Learning Dataset
Task: Implement Recurrent Networks and achieve >85% accuracy on test set

## Homework Assignment

Due: Next week before lecture

1. Implement the Recurrent Networks algorithm from scratch
2. Compare performance with sklearn/PyTorch implementation
3. Write a 2-page analysis of results
4. Prepare questions for next lecture
