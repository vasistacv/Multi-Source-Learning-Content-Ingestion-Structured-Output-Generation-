MEETING TRANSCRIPT: AI Product Strategy Session
=====================================
Date: 2026-01-10
Duration: 90 minutes
Attendees: Sarah Chen (CPO), Michael Rodriguez (AI Lead), Emily Park (PM), David Kim (Engineering Manager)

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
-----------------
Discussed roadmap for integrating large language models into our core product. Key decisions: adopt RAG architecture, 
prioritize content generation features over chatbot, and allocate 3 engineers for Q1 implementation.

DETAILED DISCUSSION
-------------------

[00:00] Sarah Chen:
"Let's start with the elephant in the room. Every competitor is adding AI features. But I don't want us to just 
slap ChatGPT on our product and call it innovation. We need to think strategically about where AI creates real 
value for our users."

[05:12] Michael Rodriguez:
"I've been evaluating different architectures. The pure LLM approach is flashy but limited. I'm strongly advocating 
for a Retrieval-Augmented Generation system. Here's why: our users have domain-specific documents, contracts, and 
proprietary data. A RAG system can ground responses in their actual content rather than hallucinating."

[12:30] Emily Park:
"From user research, we identified three high-impact use cases:
1. Automatic document summarization - saves 2 hours per user per week
2. Intelligent search across unstructured data - current keyword search misses 40% of relevant content
3. Template-based content generation - users spend 30% of time on repetitive writing

The summarization has the highest ROI based on time savings."

[25:45] David Kim:
"Engineering perspective: RAG is more complex than fine-tuning, but more maintainable. We'd need:
- Vector database infrastructure (ChromaDB or Pinecone)
- Embedding pipeline for user documents
- Context retrieval layer
- LLM integration with prompt engineering
Estimated 12 week timeline with 3 full-time engineers."

[40:00] Sarah Chen:
"I'm concerned about data privacy. We can't send user documents to OpenAI servers."

[42:15] Michael Rodriguez:
"Completely agree. I propose we use Mistral 7B locally with 4-bit quantization. It runs on consumer GPUs, 
responses are comparable to GPT-3.5 for our use cases, and all data stays on-premise. We tested it last week - 
average latency is under 2 seconds."

[55:30] Emily Park:
"What about the competitive timeline? Acme Corp launched their AI assistant last month."

[56:00] Sarah Chen:
"Good products beat fast products. Let's do this right. I'd rather launch in Q2 with a RAG system that actually 
works than rush a wrapper around GPT-4 in Q1."

DECISIONS MADE
--------------
1. Adopt RAG architecture with local Mistral 7B model
2. Phase 1 (Q1): Document summarization only
3. Phase 2 (Q2): Intelligent search
4. Phase 3 (Q3): Content generation templates
5. Allocate 3 engineers starting next sprint
6. Budget approval: $50K for GPU infrastructure

ACTION ITEMS
------------
- [Michael] Proof-of-concept RAG system with sample data - Due: Jan 20
- [Emily] User testing plan for summarization feature - Due: Jan 15
- [David] Technical architecture document - Due: Jan 18
- [Sarah] Present to board for budget approval - Due: Jan 25

METRICS TO TRACK
----------------
- Summary accuracy (human eval) - Target: >85%
- Response latency - Target: <3 seconds
- User adoption rate - Target: 40% within first month
- Time saved per user - Target: 2 hours/week

RISKS IDENTIFIED
----------------
- Local model may not scale to all document types
- Embedding cost for large document collections
- User expectations set by ChatGPT might be too high
