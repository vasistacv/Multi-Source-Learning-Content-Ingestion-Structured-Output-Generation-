VISION
------
Design an AI-powered learning platform that adapts to individual student learning patterns, providing personalized 
content recommendations and difficulty adjustments in real-time.

RESEARCH FINDINGS PRESENTATION
-------------------------------

[00:00] Marcus Johnson:
"I want to share findings from our 6-month study with 500 students across 3 universities. We tracked learning 
outcomes with adaptive vs. traditional content delivery. Key findings:

1. Students using adaptive pathways showed 27% improvement in retention compared to linear curriculum
2. Completion rates increased from 68% to 84%
3. Time-to-mastery varied significantly - fastest learners needed 40% less time than average

But here's the critical insight: one-size-fits-all algorithms don't work. Visual learners needed different 
content flow than analytical learners. We identified 5 distinct learning archetypes."

[15:30] Priya Sharma:
"From an AI perspective, this maps perfectly to multi-armed bandit algorithms. We can model each student's 
learning trajectory and optimize content recommendations. The challenge is cold start - we know nothing about 
a new user.

I propose a hybrid approach:
- First 2 weeks: diagnostic assessment to identify learning archetype
- Weeks 3-4: Constrained exploration with safety bounds
- Week 5+: Full personalization based on historical performance

We'd use Thompson Sampling for the recommendation engine. It balances exploration and exploitation naturally."

[30:00] Professor Jennifer Adams:
"I appreciate the technical rigor, but let's not forget pedagogical principles. Spaced repetition, retrieval 
practice, and interleaving are proven learning strategies. Any adaptive algorithm must respect these foundations.

For example, if a student masters a concept, we shouldn't immediately move on. Research shows spacing that 
knowledge over time - what's called the 'forgetting curve' - actually strengthens retention."

[45:15] Alex Chen:
"From UX research, students reported feeling 'lost' when content jumped around too much. They want *some* 
structure and predictability. I propose we show students a visual learning path with branches, so they understand 
why certain content is recommended."

DEEP DIVE: KNOWLEDGE GRAPH ARCHITECTURE
----------------------------------------

[52:00] Priya Sharma:
"Let me sketch out the technical architecture. At the core is a knowledge graph where:
- Nodes represent concepts (e.g., 'Derivatives', 'Chain Rule', 'Optimization')
- Edges represent prerequisite relationships
- Each node has difficulty ratings and learning objectives

When a student completes an exercise, we update their mastery estimate using Item Response Theory. The adaptive 
engine then recommends the optimal next concept based on:
- Current mastery levels
- Prerequisite satisfaction
- Learning velocity
- Engagement signals"

[65:00] Marcus Johnson:
"How do we prevent algorithmic pigeonholing? If the model decides a student is 'struggling,' does it only show 
easier content? That could limit growth."

[66:30] Priya Sharma:
"Excellent question. We implement 'challenge injection' - periodically presenting slightly-above-current-level 
content to test boundaries. If the student succeeds, we update our model of their capability. It's inspired by 
Vygotsky's Zone of Proximal Development."

DECISIONS & ROADMAP
-------------------
1. Build dual-architecture: rule-based system (first 2 weeks) + ML-based (ongoing)
2. Implement knowledge graph with 500 core concepts for pilot subject (Calculus)
3. Use Thompson Sampling for content recommendation
4. Integrate spaced repetition algorithms (SM-2 variant)
5. Develop transparent UI showing learning path
6. Run 3-month pilot with 200 students starting March

ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS
-----------------------
- Ensure algorithm doesn't reinforce existing biases
- Provide opt-out from personalization
- Human instructor oversight on learning paths
- Regular audits of recommendation fairness

METRICS FOR SUCCESS
-------------------
- Learning gain (pre-test to post-test): Target +35%
- Engagement time: Target 20 min/day average
- Completion rate: Target 85%
- Student satisfaction (NPS): Target >50
